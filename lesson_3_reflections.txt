When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share the repository with another user or when I'm working from more than one computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you may have to do multiple commits before you're done with a modification.
